# ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This repository contains a series of Java exercises focused on practicing collections, iterators, file reading, and writing.

# ðŸ§© Exercises Summary

- **Exercise 1:** Create a `Month` class with a `name` attribute. Insert months into an `ArrayList`, properly positioning "August". Convert the list into a `HashSet` to ensure no duplicates, and traverse the collections using a `for` loop and an `Iterator`.

- **Exercise 2:** Create and fill a `List<Integer>`. Using a `ListIterator`, insert the elements of the first list into a second list in reverse order.

- **Exercise 3:** Read a `countries.txt` file containing countries and their capitals. Save the data into a `HashMap<String, String>`. Create a quiz that asks the user for the capitals of random countries, score the answers, and save the user's name and score into `classificacio.txt`.
