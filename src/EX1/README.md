# 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This project involves creating a class called `Month` with an attribute `name` (which will store the month's name).  
You must add 11 `Month` objects (each with a different name) into an `ArrayList`, excluding the month "August".  
Afterward, insert "August" in the correct position and demonstrate that the `ArrayList` maintains the correct order.

Next, convert the previous `ArrayList` into a `HashSet` and ensure that no duplicate entries are allowed.

Finally, traverse the list using both a `for` loop and an `Iterator`.

# 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anaberod/S1.03_JavaCollections_LV1.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

# ▶️ Execution

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.  
Locate the `Main` class containing the `main` method.
